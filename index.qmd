Welcome to my webpage! Let me introduce myself briefly.

*I am a Ph.D. student and a research assistant in the Industrial Engineering Department at Hacettepe University. I am extremely passionate about the fields of data science, statistical learning, and machine learning.*

*I have honed my programming skills in R and Python. I typically use LaTeX to prepare my projects and assignments.*

*Recently, I have been delving into solving optimization problems using the Gurobi optimizer. Additionally, I am in the process of learning Quarto in R, as well as improving my knowledge of Git and GitHub.*
